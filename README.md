* A IOT Desktop Application

# Inspiration:
* When the history of the 21st century is written it will be known as the Age of the Machines. Over the coming decades machines will be intimately involved in every part of our lives from the cradle to the grave and playing a key role in the poorest of states as well as the wealthiest countries.

* This internet of things will link computers, cars, mobile phones, clothes, fridges, food, fields, plants, planes and people. Nothing will escape measurement, because everything means something according to the theory of the IoT. 
* Nowadays, healthcare landscape is changing drastically and many organizations are seeking ways to make improvements amidst the evolution. To reach this new level of efficiency, accuracy and patient safety, organizations need real-time visibility and intelligence into their data such as patient records, specimens, medications, supply inventories, etc.

# Problem Statement:

This kind of information can be used to know about a person’s lifestyle and their critical vital signs. Based on the water consumption per day a doctor can deduce about a person’s wellbeing. 
* So there is a need for an application which will notify the user and also in some cases act on its own to benefit the user for a healthier lifestyle.

The application can manage his or her house based on the vital signs received continuously through the sensors attached. The vital sign history will help doctors to give better consulting based on the regime.

These activities will trigger the healthy environment at home by controlling the appliances.
* Additionally, Doctors can use these vital sign history and his or her regime to provide the person a better consultation.

# Build With:
* Java SE, NetBeans IDE , Abstract factory pattern, DB4OUtils for Data persistance, Health vital signs capture.
